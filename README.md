# MiniProject
For the mini project, we were tasked with creating software that recognizes the location of blue tape and rotates a wheel a certain amount in accordance to where the tape is.
For example, if the tape is in the bottom left quadrant of the camera the wheel will turn 270 degrees (3/2pi radians) and the LCD will desplay that angle.
The Arduino code controls how fast the wheel spins and what position it spins to. 
The Raspberry Pi code controls the LCD screen and the camera.
