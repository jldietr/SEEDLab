# SEEDLab
Fall 2021 - Team 7
Github repository for code throughout the semester.
The purpose of this repository is to share our groups code with eachother (and the professor for grading).
We will use this as the main area to share docs and code for easy use and reference for later projects.
Each project will be placed in its own branch with its own code and documents.
This orginization will help kept the team orgaized, if the teams needs it more branches in these branches will be added.
Files and orginization will be updated throughout the semester as more improvements are made.
